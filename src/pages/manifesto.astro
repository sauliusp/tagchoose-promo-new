        <h2 class="font-serif text-3xl text-text">The Problem: Bookmark Anxiety is Real</h2>
        <p>
          I built #TagChoose to solve my own problem. My bookmark list was a digital graveyard. When I needed a link I'd saved weeks ago, it was often faster to just re-Google it than to dig through dozens of poorly organized folders. I tried being more thoughtful about where to save things, but that just added friction and slowed me down. The traditional, hierarchical folder system simply isn't built for the way our minds work.

        <h2 class="font-serif text-3xl text-text">The Philosophy: Think in Parallels, Not Hierarchies</h2>
        <p>
          #TagChoose is built on a simple premise: we should file things the way we think. Our brains connect ideas associatively, in parallel. A single idea can relate to technology, startups, AND productivity all at once. That's why we use tags. By allowing a single bookmark to exist in multiple "folders" (tags) simultaneously, you create a personal knowledge web that's intuitive to search and effortless to organize.

        <h2 class="font-serif text-3xl text-text">Our Guiding Principles</h2>
        <h3 class="font-serif text-2xl text-primary mt-8">1. Your Data is Yours. Period.</h3>
        <p>
          This is our most important promise. #TagChoose is private by design. It uses an on-device AI model, which means your Browse data, your bookmarks, and your tags never leave your computer. There are no accounts, no cloud sync, and zero data sent to external servers.
        </p>
        <h3 class="font-serif text-2xl text-primary mt-8">2. Software Should Respect Your Flow.</h3>
        <p>
          Productivity tools should be fast and get out of your way. We designed #TagChoose with a keyboard-first user experience. A simple shortcut opens the extension, the AI gives you a head start with suggestions, and a quick 'Enter' saves the bookmark. It's built to be a seamless part of your workflow, not an interruption.
        </p>
         <h3 class="font-serif text-2xl text-primary mt-8">3. You Are Always in Control.</h3>
        <p>
          AI should assist, not dictate. Our extension suggests tags to help you, but you always have the final say. You can edit the bookmark title, accept the AI's suggestions, or choose your own tags from your list of existing folders. The power is always yours.
