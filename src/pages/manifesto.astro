            The way we organize information should mirror how our minds actually work—not how computers think we should work.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="prose prose-lg prose-invert max-w-none">
          <div class="bg-gray-900 bg-opacity-50 p-8 rounded-lg border border-gray-700 mb-12">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-primary mb-4">The Problem with Folders</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
              For decades, we've been forced to organize our digital lives using rigid folder hierarchies—a system designed for filing cabinets, not human brains. When you save a link about "CSS Grid layouts for responsive design," where does it go?
            </p>
            <ul class="text-gray-300 space-y-2">
              <li>• Web Development → CSS → Grid?</li>
              <li>• Design → Responsive → Techniques?</li>
              <li>• Tutorials → Frontend → Advanced?</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mt-4">
              Every choice excludes other valid ways to categorize that same piece of information. Folders force artificial boundaries on naturally interconnected knowledge.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-gray-900 bg-opacity-50 p-8 rounded-lg border border-gray-700 mb-12">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-primary mb-4">How Your Brain Actually Works</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
              Your mind doesn't store memories in folders. Instead, it creates rich networks of associations. A single piece of information connects to multiple concepts simultaneously. When you remember something, you follow these associative pathways.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-300">
              Tags mirror this natural process. That CSS Grid article can simultaneously be tagged as <span class="bg-primary bg-opacity-20 text-primary px-2 py-1 rounded">css</span>, <span class="bg-primary bg-opacity-20 text-primary px-2 py-1 rounded">grid</span>, <span class="bg-primary bg-opacity-20 text-primary px-2 py-1 rounded">responsive</span>, <span class="bg-primary bg-opacity-20 text-primary px-2 py-1 rounded">tutorial</span>, and <span class="bg-primary bg-opacity-20 text-primary px-2 py-1 rounded">advanced</span>—because it genuinely relates to all these concepts.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-gray-900 bg-opacity-50 p-8 rounded-lg border border-gray-700 mb-12">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-primary mb-4">The Privacy Imperative</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
              Your bookmarks, notes, and saved content form an intimate map of your interests, research, and thinking patterns. This data should never leave your device.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-300">
              #TagChoose processes everything locally. No cloud servers, no data harvesting, no "anonymized" analytics. Your information architecture remains entirely under your control, where it belongs.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-primary mb-4">Speed as a Feature</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
              When tools are slow, we adapt our behavior to accommodate their limitations. We save fewer things, search less frequently, and gradually lose touch with our collected knowledge.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-300">
              Fast tools encourage exploration and experimentation. When finding information is instant, you're more likely to capture interesting links, build connections between ideas, and actually use what you've saved.
