      <p>Over the past week, some users running the latest versions of Chrome encountered an error message: "AI features are not supported in your browser." I want to be transparent about what happened and how it's been fixed.</p>

      <p>After a recent Chrome update, users began seeing the error message, preventing the use of AI features.</p>
      <h3>Root Cause</h3>
      <p>The issue was caused by Chromeâ€™s official transition from an experimental "Origin Trial" AI API to the new, stable LanguageModel API.</p>
      <h3>The Solution</h3>
      <p>I have completed a full migration of #TagChoose to use Chromeâ€™s new native AI API. This not only resolves the error but also improves performance and reliability. This fix is included in the v1.0.0 release.</p>
